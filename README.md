Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an AI pipeline that processes an input image to segment, identify, and analyze objects within the image. The pipeline outputs a summary table with mapped data for each object.

Step-by-Step Workflow
Image Segmentation

Objective: Segment all objects within an input image.
Method: Use a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model from PyTorch, which is known for its effectiveness in segmenting objects within images.
Process:
Load and transform the input image into a tensor format suitable for the model.
Use the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to predict and segment objects within the image.
Visualize the segmented objects by overlaying the predicted masks on the original image.
Object Extraction and Storage

Objective: Extract each segmented object from the image and store them with unique identifiers.
Method: Utilize OpenCV and PIL for image processing.
Process:
Convert the original image to a NumPy array for processing.
For each segmentation mask, binarize it to ensure it contains only 0s and 1s.
Apply the mask to the original image to isolate each object.
Save the extracted object images with unique filenames in a designated directory.
Object Identification

Objective: Identify and describe each extracted object.
Method: Use the CLIP model from Hugging Face Transformers, which combines image and text processing capabilities.
Process:
Load the CLIP model and processor.
For each extracted object image, process it using the CLIP model to generate a description.
Store the generated descriptions.
Text/Data Extraction from Objects

Objective: Extract any text present within each object image.
Method: Use Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
Process:
For each extracted object image, apply Tesseract OCR to extract text.
Store the extracted text corresponding to each object image.
Summarize Object Attributes

Objective: Summarize the nature and attributes of each object.
Method: Combine the descriptions and extracted text to generate a comprehensive summary for each object.
Process:
For each object, combine its description and extracted text to create a summary.
Store these summaries.
Data Mapping

Objective: Map all extracted data and attributes to each object and the master input image.
Method: Use JSON to structure and store the mapped data.
Process:
Create a JSON structure to map each object's unique identifier to its description, extracted text, and summary.
Save this mapping to a JSON file for easy access and further analysis.
Output Generation

Objective: Output the original image with annotations and a table containing all mapped data.
Method: Use Pandas for data structuring and CSV generation.
Process:
Convert the JSON data structure into a Pandas DataFrame.
Save the DataFrame as a CSV file for tabular representation of the data.
Optionally, annotate the original image with object identifiers and their corresponding summaries.
